    -> It works by storing copies of website content on edge servers ocated close to end users, which reduces the distance data needs to travel and speeds up the content delivery.

React.CreateElement - It is an React element not an HTML tag: do console.log the element and see it yourself in the console
- Elements created in react are React objects and not HTML tags and browser understand it as HTML

Follow the Example Code-1 (EC-1) for creating nested HTML tags in react

In real-world will be complex nested structure. This makes code complicated.
For this reason the JSX is used.
In JSX, we do not use 'createElement'

If you want execute a project or package use 'npx'

what does parcel does to the project?
- Dev build
- Local servers
- HMR - Hot module replacement
- File watching algorithm (it is written in c++)
- Gives faster build because of cache (file: .parcel-cache)
- Image optimization
- Minification of file for production
- Bundling the files
- compresses the file
- Consistent hashing
- Code splitting
- Differential Bundling
- Tree shaking - remove unused code
